This post is about explaining simply the ASGI specification. The link to the complete specification is [here](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).  

## What is ASGI ? Simply ?

ASGI stands for Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface. It's a specification for web servers and Python web applications or frameworks, 
to promote web application portability across a variety of web servers.
ASGI is the successor of WSGI

## Difference between web servers and web frameworks like Django, flask .. ? 

I confused the 2 terms for a long time because of the fact that they are sometimes used interchangeably, but there are differences and they have different responsabilities. 
Let's cite some :
- Web frameworks like Django, fastapi, flask are mainly responsible for handling routing and handling the endpoints logic
- Web servers like uvicorn are responsible for managing the http connection with the client, parsing the incoming HTTP connection, and converting it to a ASGI object that will be passed to the web frameworks

In summary, when a request is sent from a client : 
- The web server (uvicorn as an example) receives the request
- The web server forward the request to the web framework (flask or fastapi) that will processes the request 
- The web framework returns a response object to the web server
- The web server will return the response to the client


## Basic ASGI app ?

Here is how a basic ASGI app can look like in its simplest form : 
```python

async def asgi_app(scope, receive, send):
    event = await receive()
    ...
    return send({'type': 'websocket.send', ...})
```

A basic asgi app accepts 3 parameters : 
- **scope** : It is a dictionary containing information about the connection, a basic scope might look like this 
```python
{
    'type': 'http',
    'path': '/users/',
    'headers': [
        (b'Authorization', b'Bearer mytoken'),
    ],
}
```
- **receive event** : It is an asynchronous callable that the asgi app calls to receive events/messages from either the client or server
It is called like this : 

```python
message = await receive()
```
The value of the receive event might look like this 
```python
{
    "type": "http.request",
    "body": b"some raw bytes of the request body",
    "more_body": False  }
```

- **send event** : It is also an asynchronous callable, and it is used to send data to the client.
Here is an example of how this parameter can be used 

```python
await send({
    "type": "http.response.start",
    "status": 200,
    "headers": [
        [b"content-type", b"text/plain"],
        [b"x-custom-header", b"my-value"]
    ]
}
)
```
## How will the ASGI server find our ASGI callable function code ? 

When we run an ASGI server like uvicorn, like doing *uvicorn --host=0.0.0.0 main:app*, we specify the module that contains our main ASGI callable code. 
We also specify the main callable function. Then the server will import the app module, look for the async callable function, and then handle the request lifecycle (scope, receive, send).

## Hello world **ASGI** app
Below you'll find a simple hello world app, using the concepts above

```python
async def app(scope, receive, send):
    assert scope["type"] == "http"  ## We usually start by checking the type and the method specified in the scope
    assert scope["method"] == "GET"
    msg = await receive()
    await send(
        {
            "type": "http.response.start",
            "status": 200,
            "headers": [[b"content-type", b"text/plain"]],
        }
    )

    await send(
        {
            "type": "http.response.body",
            "body": b"Hello, world!",
        }
    )

```
You can run this code with *uvicorn* and you'll get Hello world

## ASGI app using starlette 

Some Python framework, like starlette, offer the option to be used as a complete framework, or as an ASGI toolkit where you can define the ASGI server manually.
Here is a simple example taken from their [README file](https://github.com/encode/starlette?tab=readme-ov-file#framework-or-toolkit)


```python
from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse

async def app(scope, receive, send):
    assert scope['type'] == 'http'
    response = PlainTextResponse('Hello, world!')
    await response(scope, receive, send)
```

Here is another example, where starlette is used both as a web server and as a web framework
```python

from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.requests import Request
from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse
from starlette.routing import Route

async def home(request: Request):
    return PlainTextResponse("Home")


async def hello(request: Request):
    return PlainTextResponse("Hello")


starlette_app = Starlette(
    debug=True,
    routes=[
        Route("/", home),
        Route("/hello", hello),
    ],
)

async def app(scope, receive, send):

    await starlette_app(scope, receive, send)
```
## Lifespan protocol ?
It is a specification that defines what the ASGI server does, in some specific events, such as startup and shutdown within ASGI.
Here is a simple implementation

```python

from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse


async def app(scope, receive, send):
    if scope["type"] == "lifespan":
        while True:
            message = await receive()
            if message["type"] == "lifespan.startup":
                print("Do something at startup")
                await send({"type": "lifespan.startup.complete"})
            elif message["type"] == "lifespan.shutdown":
                print("Do something at shutdown")
                await send({"type": "lifespan.shutdown.complete"})
                return
    else:
        response = PlainTextResponse("Hello, world!")
    await response(scope, receive, send)
```

## Summary
All the concepts above are just a basic introduction, there is more to know on this topic. Do not hesitate to look into the documentation for any more explanation.
I would also be very happy to discuss further and learn more on this topic with anyone interested.
