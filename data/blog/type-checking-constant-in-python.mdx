Below is a small article in order to better understand the usage of the **TYPE_CHECKING** constant in Python

### Typing in Python ?

As we know that Python is a dynamic language, which means it only checks the types of the variables you specified at runtime.
You can read more details about that in this very well written [article](https://vickiboykis.com/2023/12/11/why-if-type_checking/).

But we can add type hints to a Python code, and it's more and more used.
The benefits of doing so are :

- Better code readability.
- Data validation by using tools like Pydantic
- Catching bugs related to the types of variables early with the help of tools like mypy

Type hints are not necessary, and some Python programmers still prefer to not use them, but I do think it's a good habit to have and it's even officially encouraged because of
the gradual integration of python types like _list_ and _dict_ in recent Python versions.

### TYPE_CHECKING constant ?

It's a constant defined in the _typing_ module that is **False** at runtime and **True** while type checking with a type checker like mypy.
We usually put the code that we don't want to be executed at runtime inside _if TYPE_CHECKING:_ condition

### When should we use that ?

Since code inside if TYPE_CHECKING: is not executed at runtime, this is a convenient way to send some information to the type checker without the code being evaluated at runtime.

One usage of TYPE_CHECKING constant is resolving some circular import errors (module A imports module B and module B imports module A) caused by adding some type annotations

#### Example ?

Consider this file _a.py_

```python
from b import B


def f(b: B) -> None:
    b.say_hello()


def g() -> None:
    print("hello world from g")
```

and this file _b.py_

```python
from a import g

import sys


class B:
    def say_hello(self) -> None:
        g()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    b = B()
    b.say_hello()
    sys.exit()
```

Running the b.py file will result in a circular import error

### Using TYPE_CHECKING

- First import TYPE_CHECKING constant from typing
- If you are using python 3.6 and below, you can just enter the problematic type as a string

```python
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from b import B


def f(b: 'B') -> None:
    b.say_hello()


def g() -> None:
    print("hello world from g")
```

- If you are using Python 3.7 and up, you can just import annotations from future module to resolve this:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from b import B


def f(b: B) -> None:
    b.say_hello()


def g() -> None:
    print("hello world from g")
```

Running the _b.py_ file will now be successful and result in printing the sentence _hello world from g_
