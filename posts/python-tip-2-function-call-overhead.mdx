In this article, we'll see a python performance tip to avoid in your code. I first came across this tip while watching [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY7yJHo0M5I) on Python performance

## Situation ?

You have a hot loop in your code (a loop iterating over many items, and which can have a serious effect on the program's performance).
Should you call a function inside this loop ? **Better no**. It's also what Guido van Rossum has suggested [in this post](https://web.archive.org/web/20180919031245/https://plus.google.com/115212051037621986145/posts/HajXHPGN752) for writing faster Python

```python
for number in range(1_000_000):
```

## Solution

Instead of calling the separate function, **consider performing the operations directly within your loop.** It's for sure not very Pythonic and it's more code, but it's better
from a performance point of view

## Example

You can test this tip from the following example

```python
import time

def multiply(x,y):
    return x*y


def a():
    start = time.time()
    x = 1
    for number in range(1_000_000):
        multiply(x,number)
    print(time.time() - start)

def b():
    start = time.time()
    x=1
    for number in range(1_000_000):
        x*number
    print(time.time() - start)
```

On my local setup, running the function a gives the following result

```text
0.06376457214355469
```

and running the function b gives the following result

```text
0.030170440673828125
```

So it's a 48 % performance improvement

## Why is that ?

In a nutshell, a function call requires that a new stack frame is created and pushed into the stack and that operation is **expensive**.
In addition to that, the python interpreter does no optimization to your code and runs it as it is. You can watch [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smiL_aV1SOc) for more details on how Python implements stack frames.

Happy Coding !
