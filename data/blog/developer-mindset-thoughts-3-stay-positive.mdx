When in a new job, if things get complicated with hard pressure and tight deadlines, remember that your mind is your biggest asset. Do not let the pressure get over you, instead focus on how to divide the problem into small pieces that can be solved one by one.
Here are some advices : 
- Celebrate every small win, no matter how small it is. 
- Embrace a growth mindset, and view problems as opportunities to grow and improve
- Direct your energy toward the problem and never to the people. Avoid at all cost wasting mental cycles on blame or on office politics
- Focus on what you can control rather than what you can’t and improve what you can control.
- If you want to talk to your manager about a problem you are facing, at least go the meeting with some solutions at hand. Your manager already has a lot of problems to deal with, try to make his/her life simpler.
