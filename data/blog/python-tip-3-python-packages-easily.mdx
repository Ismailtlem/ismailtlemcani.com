In this small blog post, I will share my tips and what I learned to quickly make your python package, and publish it with only one file.

### Useful resources on this topic

This post is mainly inspired by Simon Willison [blog post](https://til.simonwillison.net/python/pyproject) on this topic and the well known youtuber Arjan Codes [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KEObONUkik) on this subject

### Structure of the package

It's better if you can use a template to generate a skeleton of your package and its most important files. You can use [this one](https://github.com/simonw/python-lib/).

Here is how a simple cli package might looks like

### Files needed to build the package

You only need _pyproject.toml_. The mandatory table in this file is the _project_ table. In the project table, the mandatory names are the name and the version. Here is how it might look like for a Python CLI package.

```toml
[project]
name = "py-like-wc"
version = "0.2"
description = "python wc tool"
readme = "README.md"
authors = [{ name = "Ismail Tlemcani" }]
license = { text = "Apache-2.0" }
requires-python = ">=3.9"
classifiers = ["License :: OSI Approved :: Apache Software License"]
dependencies = []

```

### Build the package

You can build the package by using only the [build package](https://github.com/pypa/build) in the following way. This is now the standard way to build python packages.

```sh
python -m build
```

This command will create 2 files : a whl file and a tar file

### Publish the package

To publish the package, you can use the [twine package](https://github.com/pypa/twine). The command to do this is the following command

```sh
twine upload dist/*
```

By default, this command will upload your package to the [official PyPi repository](https://pypi.org/). If you want to upload the package to another repository, you can define a custom configuration in your _*.pypirc*_ file. This file is usually in your HOME directory

```text
[testpypi]
repository: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
username: my_username
password: my_pypi_token

```

You can see more details on how to define a _*.pypirc*_ file [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pypirc/)

You can then upload the package to the repository you defined by using the section title (testpypi in the example above) with the following command

```sh
twine upload -r testpypi dist/*
```

When uploaded, you can see your package in the repository in the url that the twine command provided in your console output

### Update the package

You simply have to change the version, and then uplaod again
