This post is a general feedback on my first participation at europython 2025 in the beautiful city of Prague. Thanks a lot to all the organizers and volunteers. Great thanks to my manager at my current job for all her support and for letting me enjoy this moment.

### What is EuroPython ?

It is the biggest python conference in Europe, and the second biggest one in the world after PyCon US. 


It was organized at a big venue which is Prague conference center. Everything was well organized, registration was very smooth, and we went very quickly to attend the first keynote.

### Attendees ?

- The number of attendees exceeded 2000, from solo developers to folks working at tech giants like Google Cloud, Microsoft, and Bloomberg.
- Many famous names of the Python community were present: many CPython core developers were present as well as people from the Python steering council, creators of popular Python framework such as Flask and FastAPI were also present, president of the Django foundation was also present ...
- So many very friendly python developers from all over the world, using Python in many different use cases

### Arrival at Prague

I arrived at Prague at the 15th of July at late at night. The hotel I booked for 5 nights costed me around 240 euros.
In the next day, I went directly to the conference venue to do the registration and start enjoying the conference.

### Days of the conference 

The 3 days were full of talks and discussing with awesome people. I tried to attend as many talks as possible.

Here are some few highlights from the talks I attended : 

- There were many talks on the new JIT compilation in Python 3.13 and that should be made default in future versions. Performance improvments is said to be around 9 %.
- Many talks about Python performance, and how to make sure to have performant code. A talk named "When in practice is Python performance an issue? Facts and myths" was particularly interesting where the speaker insisted on profiling the code to see the bootleneck.
- A talk around Generative AI named "The Boom of Generative AI: realities, promises and awkward situations" was also very interesting. The talk spoke about the recent advancements in AI and how it might change the software engineering job, since the cost of software is now dropping with all those tools available. 
- A preview of the Python documentary that will be released later this year was shown, and a discussion with Brett Cannon, Armin ronacher and Paul Everitt followed around many topics in Python ecosystem.

There were many subjects discussed in the conference. It went from topics for beginners as well as topics for advanced users.
The schedule of the conference was published on the [conference website](https://ep2025.europython.eu/schedule/talks/). The videos will be published on [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/europythonconference) later this year.

### Other activities ?

Besides the usual talks and keynotes, social events were organized to help people mingle. Main social event was organized thursday night, and The main party was on Thursday night. I didn't attend it.
On saturday, I took a break to explore Prague for the first time, and on Saturday night, I had an awesome hangout and an awesome discussion with other participants.

### Tips for the other new first timers ?

- It is great, just try it at least once and judge by yourself. Before going, I was also very hesitant at first but I had an awesome conference and I enjoyed it and I am definitely coming again next year.
- Once in the conference, try to network with as many people as possible. I am also an introvert. If approaching people is difficult for you, just ask people about their job.
- Everyone is nice and friendly, and humble. And also do not forget to be nice and smiling to other people.
- If you meet your heroes, go talk to them. They are very humble and very nice.
- If there are companies present, go talk to them. You never know from where your next opportunity might come.
- If you missed a talk, no need to worry. You can always watch it online.
- Introduce yourself to other people ! People might introduce you to other people :) it happened to me


### Impact on me ?

I had a wonderful time at this conference. The most beautiful thing was how generous, humble, and welcoming the community is — even the Python legends. 
It reminded me that behind the code, it’s all about people sharing ideas, lifting each other up, and building cool things together. That, to me, is the true spirit of being a geek.

### Will I go again ?

Yes without a double. See you in EuroPython 2026
